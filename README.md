 Project 3 Interactive Form

In this project, I use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference

The registration form contains
    Name field : If the user enters blank or number, the form will warn the user to enter a valid name. The text field will be automatically focused when the page first loads. This field will show real-time error message.

    Email field : if the user enters blank, the form will tell the user that the email field cannot be empty. If the user's email is not in valid form, the form will also tell the user to enter a valid email address. This field will show real-time error message.

    Job Role : If the user selects "Other" in the "Job Role" drop down menu, they can enter info into the "Other job role" text field. But this field should be hidden by default and only displayed once users select "Other" in the drop down menu, and be hidden if the user selects any other option.

    T-Shirt Info with size, design, and color : The options in the "Color" drop down menu are not available for each t-shirt design. So the user shouldn’t be able to see or choose a color option until they have chosen a design.

    Register for activities : When the user selects the activities, the "Total: $" should update to reflect the total cost of the user’s selected activities. The conflicting activities will also be disabled to users. This field will show real-time error message.

    and Payment Info: The credit card payment option was selected by default when the page first load. If user selects other payment option, the form should update to display only the chosen payment method section. This field will show real-time error message.
